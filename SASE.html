                                    <strong>SASE is the newly emerging concept in Cybersecurity...</strong><br><br>

                                    In August 2019, Gartner published a report "The Future of Network Security in the Cloud". 
                                    This report brought a strategic roadmap for SASE convergence. And the term SASE came into being as a new emerging cybersecurity concept.
                                   
                                    SASE (pronounced ‚Äúsassy‚Äù) = Secure Access Service Edge
                                    <br><br>
                                    Before you want to learn more about SASE, you need to sit back and think a thought with some deliberation. 
                                    Here is that--

                                    The existing networking approaches & technologies are not able to provide the right levels of 'Security' 
                                    and 'Access Control' any longer that are actually practically needed by most modern organizations.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    üëâ <strong>Why it is so?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    *  It is so because modern organizations (like yours) need immediate & uninterrupted access for their users -- 
                                    regardless of where they are located. Remote users and work-from-home employees are a reality you cannot close your eyes to.
                                    <br><br>
                                    *  Adding to this is another reality that there is very high adoption of 'SaaS' applications by all. 
                                    What is happening here is that -- A huge amount of data is moving from data-center to cloud services.
                                    <br><br>
                                    *  And more & more of 'Traffic' is first going to public cloud services and branch offices of these organizations, 
                                    than the data that is going back to their data-centers.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Briefly speaking, so much data & traffic is happening between cloud services and your users that is bypassing (to a large extent) 
                                    your own data-center & security implementations, that you need a fundamentally new approach for networking and network security.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    üëâüëâ <strong>WHAT IS SASE?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Palo Alto describes that--
                                    <br><br>
                                    SASE is the convergence of wide-area networking or WAN, and network security services like CASB, FWaaS, and Zero Trust, into a single cloud-delivered service model.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Gartner throws a little more light on SASE, as it mentions that SASE capabilities are delivered as a service-based upon the followings:
                                    <br>
                                    *  The identity of the entity<br>
                                    *  Real-time context<br>
                                    *  Enterprise security/compliance policies<br>
                                    *  Continuous assessment of risk/trust 'throughout' the sessions
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>A small explanation:</strong><br>
                                    ------------------------<br>
                                    Identities of entities can be associated (read, defined) in terms of people, 
                                    groups of people (branch offices), devices, applications, services, IoT systems or edge computing locations.
                                    <br><br>
                                    SASE is a kind of dictum that --The future of network security is in the cloud! Because in a cloud-driven 
                                    world, your security needs to be unified, fully integrated, and consistent and should be delivered from the 
                                    cloud that it‚Äôs chartered to protect.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <i>‚ÄúThe secure access service edge is an emerging offering (solutions/services) combining comprehensive WAN 
                                    capabilities with comprehensive network security functions (such as SWG, CASB, FWaaS, and ZTNA, etc) to 
                                    support the dynamic secure access needs of digital enterprises.‚Äù</i>
                                    <br><br>
                                    The BIG logic is staring back into our eyes. That as applications are moving to the cloud, the old method 
                                    of forcing all branches', all users', and all partners' TRAFFIC back through the corporate headquarters or 
                                    data centers no longer makes sense. It makes much more sense if you deliver the same network security stack from the cloud, 
                                    in such a way that this traffic destined for the cloud does not have to hit your corporate network, 
                                    and less traffic needs to go to corporate data centers.

                                    Regardless of the current state of affairs in the cybersecurity industry where companies have been forced to work with dozens of 
                                    vendors and use dozens of point products and technologies. Yet the future of network security is in the cloud, 
                                    and security vendors would have to evolve in order to effectively secure organizations anywhere and everywhere.

                                    By removing multiple point products and adopting a single cloud-delivered SASE solution, your organization can reduce complexity; 
                                    rapidly deploy and scale-out remote workers and branch locations; and enforce consistent security no matter where your users are, 
                                    all while saving significant technical, human, and financial resources.

                                                Modern companies have already adopted the SD-WAN technologies, to connect their branch offices to corporate networks and provide 
                                                local internet breakout as an alternative to costly MPLS connections. If your company is one of those, then using the SASE solution, 
                                                you would be delivering the branch architecture totally based on the cloud. You would be capable of enabling branch services, 
                                                including its security and networking from the cloud. It would make the management of your WAN highly simplified and increase your ROI.

                                                As you know that ZTNA requires your users who want to connect to an application to first authenticate through a gateway prior to 
                                                gaining access. Right? This provides security administrators the ability to identify users and create policies to restrict access, 
                                                minimize data loss, and quickly mitigate potential threats.

                                                But the problem is that many ZTNA products are based on software-defined perimeter (SDP) architectures, which do not provide content 
                                                inspection. It creates a discrepancy in the types of protection available for each application.

                                                Using a SASE service, you would build upon the ZTNA's key principles and applies them across all the other services within a SASE solution.
                                                 You would be identifying your users, devices, and applications no matter where they are connecting from. 
                                                 It greatly simplifies your policy creation and management. SASE removes the complexity of connecting to a gateway by incorporating your 
                                                 networking services into a single unified cloud framework.

                                                You don't want your users/employees to visit gambling, pornography, streaming entertainment websites, e.g., Netflix, etc.

                                                Since there are already too-many types of cloud-based services, it would highly imperative to most companies to integrate well 
                                                these services with an effective SASE solution. It is a MUST and goes without saying.

                                                A SASE solution should embrace the integration of third-party services too (regardless of who is the vendor offering them) and 
                                                simplify the process for administrators by providing a platform that easily integrates other services. In order to help companies 
                                                do that SASE provides needs to give them full support.
