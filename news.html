                            What is the news exactly, (N)orth.(E)ast.(W)est.(S)outh,
                            it's supposed to be a direction that leads to informing the masses on current events that require the public
                            views and opinion,
                            but what happens when the very same trusted journalists are now reporting on issues that are either irrelevant
                            or biased.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An independent news organization should always strive to first conduct investigations on relevant issues and
                            currently impacting the nation the most. However, they should not be restricted in their path to the truth if
                            they complete the study lawfully and respectably without being influenced by emotions or their employers.
                            Although everyone who calls themselves a journalist should be impartial when it comes to uncovering the truth,
                            there should be measure in place that ensure the safety of these people in their pursuit of the truth since many
                            of them might find damming evidence against top officials in power who might be threatened by the fact and wish
                            them harm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that transparency between organization or individuals, whether in politics, education,
                            whatever industry or anywhere is and should be made mandatory law because most people who desire power have other
                            agendas than the one that they disclose to the public and feel as though after they have amassed that power,
                            they are not answerable to anyone which leave them with the will that they can do almost virtually anything and
                            get away with it, so it's up to our journalists to be the over-watchers of these individuals and provide the
                            public relevant information about any wrong-doing or accomplishment that they achieve in their position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Historically, respect has been mostly granted to undeserving individuals who obtained it through fear or
                            subjugation of the people they deem lesser. That should not be the case. The word respect its self has lost all
                            merit and value s it has been given to literally anyone who holds a higher position or is regarded as necessary
                            based on their status. Our news organization and outlets should strive to bring news that is accurate and fair
