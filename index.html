                                  <p>
                                      Since the Soweto uprising there has been a lot of changes over the years in our countries education curriculum ,
                                      but these changes have been only about the standard of teaching and has since done little to advance the infrastructure as well ,
                                      a lot of rural school have to rely on school fees paid by parents and that is also not enough,
                                      we need better infrastructure before we have better education and we need to make sure that all our school are in a position to
                                      fully cater to each and every child’s needs that being said each child should feel safe and be able to improve not only their
                                      mental capacity but also the physical and emotional well-being . We need to ensure that each school can cater for each child
                                      in every village.
